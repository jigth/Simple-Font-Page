        <p>
        This is a simple font page, made with <em>Roboto Slab</em> and
        <em>Roboto Medium</em>. It's simple Enough to have just typographies and
        demonstrate the
        <em><strong>CSS @Fontface</strong> property at the same time</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you want to see this page clearly, please disable DarkMode temporary as
        it has no support for that right now
        </p>
        <p>
        As for the HTML, it have been formated with Prettier, automatic formating
        is usually better and way easier than doing all of that manually. It's
        great to be able to focus on what I need to achieve and not too much on
        the looks of my code, just make it clean enough to be understandable by
        people.
        </p>
        <p>Now lets just add some nonsense to enjoy this typography.</p>
